#Project Overview
Network sniffing and parsing packets using Raw-sockets
#Why this matter?
-As traffic detecting and analysis is important in AI systems, APIS
-also this project define why encryption and monitoring are required 
#skills Demonstrated
1.Raw socket programming
2.TCP,IP header
3.Defensive network monitoring
#AI security Relevence;
1.AI prompts models travel over network
